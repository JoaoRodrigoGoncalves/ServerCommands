# ServerCommands

#Commands
Use !commands or !comandos to show the list of commands.

#How it works?
This plugin creates a menu with all registered commands and shows it to the client. After the player selects one of the commands, it will show another menu with the respective description and an option to run that command.

#TO-DO
Add a config file and use key values to set the commands/descriptions that should appear in the menu!
